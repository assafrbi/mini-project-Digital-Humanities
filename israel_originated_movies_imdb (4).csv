During the day he is a genuine loser who lives with his mother and plays the part of a vacuum cleaner in a children's play. At night he is the leader of a rebellious Indy band that is overlooked by the establishment and the public. His pitiful personal and professional life propels Nati into creating a dark and narcissistic split personality known as Gotel Botel. Gotel brings Nati greatness: he avenges his enemies, creates a successful underground show and conquers the heart of Ayelet, Nati's secret love. As expected of an Indy band, its band members are just as weird. Hila, his good friend and show manager, dreams of hitting the charts. Tal, the band's guitarist, is torn between his love of music and his wife who demands that he grow up. Noa is the anarchistic cello player who goes on a rampage of urban terror. Gotel makes Nati's dreams come true, but Nati isn't all that sure this is a good thing. Nati and Ayelet's relationship deteriorates as a result of Gotel's megalomaniacal and violent nature. The show becomes a hit but is commercialized and Nati starts losing his grip on reality. Nati and Gotel head to battle, but this time they are against one. Nati must choose. Will he remain loyal to his art or will he sacrifice himself for success? The film tells the sad story of the world of commercial art, in which the greatest danger is the loss of one's identity. It is a world which loses its color from day to day, where weird characters are the only hope for individuality. The movie is inspired by the anarchism of its characters and thus creates a wild circus of diverse genres. The movie consists of a fictional script embedded with genuine actors, locations, situations and archives based on three years of filming the actual band. As the character of Gotel takes hold of Nati, the fiction takes hold of the documentary reality until they both merge into one solid half-truth. The film is an attempt to present the alternative culture in its roughest form. It is a world of sub-culture, a world in which people don't try to disguise their deviations. On the contrary, they praise them. It is a colorful and free universe that collapses time after time due to a more conservative reality.::Daniel Sivan",2251648

1218,Burning Memory,1989,Drama,"On April 9, 1948, a Jewish militia entered the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin and killed over 100 villagers. Soon after, a mental hospital was built on the ruins. The first patients to be committed were Holocaust survivors. A legend says that to this day, the survivors have been communicating with the ghosts of the village. FORGIVENESS tells the story of David Adler, a 20-year old American-Israeli who decides to move back to Israel, only to find himself committed to a mental institution that sits on the ruins of a Palestinian village called Deir Yassin. Flashbacks and flashforwards reveal the events that led up to his hospitalization. A 10-year old female ghost holds the secret to the riddle. But only when the secret is revealed can she find rest and give David the option to end a perpetually-repeated destiny... Doctor Itzhik Shemesh, a psychiatrist at the mental institute, injects David with a chemo-technological drug in an attempt to build a bridge over the trauma zone and allow David to live a normal life. Even though he doubts its ethical consequences, his use of the drug is an act that mirrors his own deep denial... Doctor Shemesh is given permission to use the drug by David's father, Henry Adler, a Holocaust survivor who spent a short time in Israel before becoming one of the most pre-eminent musicians in America. Henry, who has the arrogance of Oedipus and faith in the rational overcoming of trauma via action, doesn't understand why his son has been hospitalized. But Henry's lust for life and his desire for normality make him live in denial of the past, which is unbearable for David, whose restless soul seeks the truth. Henry will confront a horror beyond all horrors when the truth reveals itself. A blind patient in the hospital named Muselmann, also a Holocaust survivor, tells David to listen to the ghosts that are haunting him, that they have something important to tell him. Like the blind prophet Tiresias, Muselmann knows that the truth does not hold redemption, and this is why he never tried to reconstruct his life after the camps. Because he lives between the world of the dead and the living, Muselmann can act as a conduit between the murdered ghosts and David. The flashbacks and flashforwards from the mental institute reveal, with the story of David's life, the story of the eternal return of the trauma and a destiny that seems unalterable...::Anonymous",0126639
