# mini-project-Digital-Humanities


Main project Idea: Topic modeling based on Israeli movies summaries

Main objectives:
  1. As we learned in class, metadata accessibility is important for next generations and we can learned from it much more
  2. We thing that more data about Israeli films should be more accessable through graphic visualization
  3. The main digital humanities question is: how much the Israeli movies summaries are express the main ganre of the the movie


Work plan:
  1. Metadata resources:
    a. Imdb
    b. wikidata/wikipadia
    c. ארכיון הסרטים הישראלי
  
Tools we plan to use:
  1. Topic modeling tool (one of: Google code,mallet)
  2. Form of DB storage - yaml/json/csv/xmal
  3. Import data by pythons scripts (Api call) 
  4. Graphic tools - pyLDAvis 
  5. Presentation - Wix site 

The final project:
  1. working site that contains all relevant data presented by graphs 
  2. List of top movies that has correlations betweem the the ganer and the modeling resualts 
  3. correlations betweem directors and modeling resualts
