Main project Idea: Topic modeling based on Israeli movies summaries

Main objectives:
  1. As we learned in class, metadata accessibility is important for next generations and we can learned from it much more
  2. We thing that more data about Israeli films should be more accessable through graphic visualization
  3. The main digital humanities question is: how much the Israeli movies summaries are express the main ganre of the the movie
