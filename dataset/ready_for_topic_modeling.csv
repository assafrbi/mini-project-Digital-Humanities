But only when the secret is revealed can she find rest and give David the option to end a perpetually-repeated destiny... Doctor Itzhik Shemesh, a psychiatrist at the mental institute, injects David with a chemo-technological drug in an attempt to build a bridge over the trauma zone and allow David to live a normal life.

Because he lives between the world of the dead and the living, Muselmann can act as a conduit between the murdered ghosts and David.

Gotel brings Nati greatness: he avenges his enemies, creates a successful underground show and conquers the heart of Ayelet, Nati's secret love. As expected of an Indy band, its band members are just as weird. Hila, his good friend and show manager, dreams of hitting the charts. Tal, the band's guitarist, is torn between his love of music and his wife who demands that he grow up. Noa is the anarchistic cello player who goes on a rampage of urban terror. Gotel makes Nati's dreams come true, but Nati isn't all that sure this is a good thing. Nati and Ayelet's relationship deteriorates as a result of Gotel's megalomaniacal and violent nature. The show becomes a hit but is commercialized and Nati starts losing his grip on reality. Nati and Gotel head to battle, but this time they are against one. Nati must choose. Will he remain loyal to his art or will he sacrifice himself for success? The film tells the sad story of the world of commercial art, in which the greatest danger is the loss of one's identity.

On the contrary, they praise them. It is a colorful and free universe that collapses time after time due to a more conservative reality."
